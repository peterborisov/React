# React
## Hooks
#### Basic Hooks
- useState 
- useEffect - let you create side effects on your components based on the dependencies.
- useContext
#### Additional Hooks
- useReducer
```
useReducer(reducer, initialState) => reducer(state, action)
```
- useCallback - avoid unnecessary re-renders. Return a memoized version of the callback, and itâ€™ll only be changed if one of the dependencies has changed.
- useMemo / memoization - used to memoize values.
- useRef
- useImperativeHandle
- useLayoutEffect
- useDebugValue

-  React's memo API - used to wrap React components to prevent re-renderings. If props/state change, rerender the component.
